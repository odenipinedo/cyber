#### What are We Talking about when We Talk about Cybersecurity?

**N**ational **I**nstitute of **S**tandards and **T**echnology, definition of cybersecurity: *The protection of information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability*

**Information Security -> Confidentiality + Integrity + Availability = CIA triad**
* **Confidentiality** - synonymous with privacy. Confidentiality measures prevent data from falling into the hands of people who do not have authorization to access said information. (e.g. encryption)
* **Integrity** - information is - and remains - accurate. (e.g. hash values)
* **Availability** - requires routine maintenance and upgrading of hardware and software. (e.g. firewalls, proxies; business continuity plans, disaster recovery, redundancy)

Other Key terms:
* **Vulnerability** - a flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited to violate system security policy. (e.g buffer overflow exploit)
* **Threat** - an event, natural or manmade, able to cause negative impact to an organization.
* **Exploit** - a way to breach the security of an IT system through a vulnerability.
* **Risk** - probability of an event involving exposure to danger.

A **vulnerability assessment** is a search for weaknesses and exposures in order to fix or prevent a compromise.
* many systems are shipped with known and unknown security flaws, bugs, and insecure default settings
* human error / system administrator misconfiguration happens

**Roles in Information Security**
* Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
* Information Security Architect
* Information Security Consultant/Specialist
* Information Security Analyst
* Information Security Auditor (ISO 27001-2)
* Security Software Developer
* Penetration Tester / Ethical Hacker (red team)
* Vulnerability Assessor
* Digital Forensic Analyst (blue team)
* SIEM Engineer

[How much is your data worth?](https://calc.datum.org)

**Online Security**
* *Data Protection* - multiple types of data and multiple ways of protecting it
* *Global Business* - not just one office in one country, not just one set of laws or compliance requirements
* *Mobile Tech* - increasing amount of confidential data in smartphones, other mobile devices, and in the cloud
* *Multiple Vendors* - need to be able to communicate in one or many languages
