#### What are We Talking about when We Talk about Cybersecurity?

**N**ational **I**nstitute of **S**tandards and **T**echnology, definition of cybersecurity: *The protection of information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability*

**Information Security -> Confidentiality + Integrity + Availability = CIA triad**
* **Confidentiality** - synonymous with privacy. Confidentiality measures prevent data from falling into the hands of people who do not have authorization to access said information. (e.g. encryption)
* **Integrity** - information is - and remains - accurate. (e.g. hash values)
* **Availability** - requires routine maintenance and upgrading of hardware and software. (e.g. firewalls, proxies; business continuity plans, disaster recovery, redundancy)

Other Key terms:
* **Vulnerability** - a flaw, loophole, oversight, or error that can be exploited to violate system security policy. (e.g buffer overflow exploit)
* **Threat** - an event, natural or manmade, able to cause negative impact to an organization.
* **Exploit** - a way to breach the security of an IT system through a vulnerability.
* **Risk** - probability of an event involving exposure to danger.

A **vulnerability assessment** is a search for weaknesses and exposures in order to fix or prevent a compromise.
* many systems are shipped with known and unknown security flaws, bugs, and insecure default settings
* human error / system administrator misconfiguration happens

**Roles in Information Security**
* Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
* Information Security Architect
* Information Security Consultant/Specialist
* Information Security Analyst
* Information Security Auditor (ISO 27001-2)
* Security Software Developer
* Penetration Tester / Ethical Hacker (red team)
* Vulnerability Assessor
* Digital Forensic Analyst (blue team)
* SIEM Engineer

[How much is your data worth?](https://calc.datum.org)

**Online Security**
* *Data Protection* - multiple types of data and multiple ways of protecting it
* *Global Business* - not just one office in one country, not just one set of laws or compliance requirements
* *Mobile Tech* - increasing amount of confidential data in smartphones, other mobile devices, and in the cloud
* *Multiple Vendors* - need to be able to communicate in one or many languages

#### Cybersecurity - A Security Architect's Perspective

**Confidentiality**
* only the sender and intended receiver should understand message contents
* sender encrypts, receiver decrypts

**Authentication**
* sender/receiver want to confirm identity of other

**Message Integrity**
* sender/receiver want to ensure that the message is unaltered in transit or afterwards without detection

**Access and Availability**
* services must be accessible and available to users

*The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made or position unassailable*
     **-- The Art of War, Sun Tzu**
	 
*The combination of space, time, and strength that must be considered as the basic elements of this theory of defense makes this a fairly complicated matter. Consequently, it is not easy to find a fixed point of departure.*
	**-- On War, Carl Von Clausewitz**
	
![Friends and enemies](images/05_Friends_Enemies.png)

* client-server relationship
* DNS servers
* routers exchanging ip tables
* firewalls communicating with security intelligence systems

**Computer Security defined by NIST**
* the protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources which includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications.

**Computer Security Challenges**
* Security is not as simple as it seems
	* easy requirements, hard solutions
* Security policy enforcement structures can be targets of attack
* Protecting enforcement structures can complicate solutions further
* Where do we deploy security solutions?
* Cryptographic key management is hard
* Protectors have to be right every time, attackers just once
* No one likes security until it is needed (seatbelt philosophy)
* Security is often viewed as something that is a barrier, in-the-way of doing business
* Security is often not part of early application development, not "baked in"
* Security needs to be agile
